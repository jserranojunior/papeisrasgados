*	Honeypot consists of data (for example, in a network site) that appears to be a legitimate part of the site but is actually isolated and monitored, and that seems to contain information or a resource of value to attackers, which are then blocked. Just as honeypots are weapons against spammers, honeypot detection systems are spammer employed counter-weapons.
